# java-todo-list
This is a basic Java application to manage tasks. It runs in the terminal (or optionally with a GUI), allowing users to:

    Add, remove, and complete tasks

    Filter tasks by status or deadline

    Save and load task data from a .txt or .json file

The goal of this project is to reinforce Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file I/O, and Java basics.
